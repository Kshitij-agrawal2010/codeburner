You can download the latest release tarball of Codeburner here: <a href="https://github.com/groupon/codeburner/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/groupon/codeburner/releases</a>

If you like to live dangerously (or want to try the latest features) you can also clone the latest master:

```
git clone https://github.com/groupon/codeburner
```

The rest of this guide assumes you're inside the directory unpacked by one of these methods when running commands.
